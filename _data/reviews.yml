  review: "The elephant tour was one of the most beautiful moments of my life. I was literally in tears when I got to feed the elephants.
    <br>
    This tour proves that you can interact with wildlife in an ethical, respectful way if you are motivated to do so. Swimming with elephants is just as magical as sitting on an elephant!
    <br>
    The tour guides were also amazing. So friendly and polite! Moreover, the lunch provided was excellent. All kinds of foods. I can highly recommend this tour!"

  review: "It was an incredible and special experience, which brought so much happiness and joy. Elephants are very unique creatures, very playfull and happy to live freely there.
    <br>
    The heads Torn and Sam are putting so much love and efforts not only to make elephants happy and healthy, but also support locals, involving them into the process.
    <br>
    We have spent trully amazing day in the jungle forest, walking, feeding and swimming with elephants, observing them and making a nice connection. Lunch was also included, along with coffee and involving stories told by Torn. I could feel that this person trully believes in this project, in a way how heartful and clear he was and how he cares about the situation of elephants and locals.
    <br>
    This beautiful day will stay in my heart forever. This project is 100% worth your support and attention!"

  review: "Brilliant and ethical experience.<br>
    This was a brilliant day - walking in the jungle with elephants and finding out more about how an ethical approach to elephant experiences can support both the local community, the local environment and the local economy.
    <br>Elephant riding isn't done on the project - but you do meet 2 elephants and get to feed them and follow them while they potter around their jungle home. 
    <br>Lunch is provided in the price which was excellent. 
    <br>You can also swim in a waterfall pool and swim with the elephants."

  review: "Don't miss the Elephant Community Project!!! Their land is so peaceful and absolutely stunning. The elephants were so calm (and hungry, lol) and cute. I enjoyed that this is the only project that is 100% owned by a Cambodian as the other projects are either only partially owned by a Cambodian or fully foreign owned. The day was so serene, and being so up close and personal with the elephants was a dream. I would have loved to spend the night at the project if I had the time. I was also very nice to stop at one of the ethnic villages and spend time interacting with the kids and community - I was so impressed. Booking a tour with the Elephant Community Project will definitely be an experience you'll never forget."

  review: "It was a lovely experience, 100% suggested! Nice trekking in the forest, close interaction with the elephants and above all lots of interesting explanations on the project and the local Bunong minority.<br>The visit to a Bunong village is an interesting plus and also the yummy lunch close to the river. A big thanks to our guide Torn !"
