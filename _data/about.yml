sam: Sam Nang has lived in Mondulkiri for more than 18 years and knows the area extremely well. He loves the region because of the hills, a cooler climate, numerous scenic waterfalls in the forest and it being different from the rest of Cambodia.
  <br><br>
  He worked as a guide for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) who sent him to Indonesia to learn about developing an ecotourism network. He lived in the forest with the Bunong people for 3 years and speaks their language. He also worked in an NGO orphanage for 3 years and in local hotels and restaurants for over 10 years. His restaurant has been open for nine years, and he opened a guesthouse last year.
  With tourism growing, Sam started an ecotourism tour company to share his expertise and experience with travellers, to support the Bunong people and heritage and to protect the environment.

  “Sen Monorom, the capital of Mondulkiri, is surrounded by protected forests that are home to rare monkeys, birds, elephants, and numerous other mammals. Seeing the sea of trees from hilltops and experiencing some of the most spectacular sunsets in the world is simply breathtaking. You become one with the spectacular multi-colored clouds in peace and quiet.” Sam

bunong:
- title: "Culture"
  text: Mondulkiri province is located in a remote mountainous area in the northeast of Cambodia, near the border of Vietnam. It is the nation's largest province and it is the home of the Bunong (or Phnong) people, the largest indigenous ethnic group of Cambodia. The Bunong population is estimated at 30,000 out of Mondulkiri's total 43,000 residents, with the Bunong language being the primary language spoken within their communities. 
    <br><br>
    The Bunong people have lived in harmonious coexistence with the region's forests for generations. Traditionally hunters, living in close harmony with nature within the forest, Bunong people are renowned for their traditional elephant taming practices. They domesticated elephants over a century ago, forging a deep and enduring bond. Since then, they have lived alongside these animals that serve as integral partners in the Bunong way of life, assisting with transportation of food or materials, such as wood and bamboo, agriculture, farming, hunting, construction of houses and other facilities, crossing rivers during the wet season and various other activities.
- title: "A Strong Bond"
  text: The bond between the elephants and the community is essential, as elephants hold a spiritual significance for the Bunong people. Elephants are famous for their intelligence, memory, and gentle nature with their caretakers. The shared animistic roots of the Bunong and elephants have strengthened the connection between the community and the elephants.
    <br><br>
    Traditionally, the Bunong deeply value their elephants, considering them family members and opposing their sale to sanctuaries or tourist attractions. They regard their elephants as respected elders, like grandparents, having lived alongside them since birth. Elephants are brought back to the village for important occasions, such as deaths, weddings, and births.
    <br><br>
    A single elephant often lives with multiple families, typically five or six. The elephant owners hold a respected position within the community, possessing specialized knowledge of elephant care and performing spiritual rituals for their well-being. As well, Bunong traditional medicine contributes to the elephants' remarkable longevity.
    <br><br>
    The bond between a mahout, the caretaker, and the elephant is profound, often lasting a lifetime. Traditionally, a mahout maintains a degree of ritual purity, dedicating his life to the elephant's well-being. This may involve abstaining from marriage, perfumes, and certain modern practices believed to be detrimental to the elephant.
- title: "Animism"
  text: Elephants are deeply connected to the community, often sensing impending events. According to Bunong traditions and beliefs, an elephant can fall ill if something wrong occurs within the village or if a community member breaks a rule, such as a child being born before marriage. To atone for such transgressions, the community performs sacrifices for both the elephant and the mahout. 
    <br><br>
    The Bunong perform monthly ritual sacrifices, honoring the elephants' spirits and importance. These ceremonies are performed to appease the spirits of the forest, asking for forgiveness if the elephants have disturbed or consumed anything considered sacred. The ceremonies, rooted in the culture and in animism, involve sacrificing animals, such as chickens and pigs, and painting designs on the elephants. The mahout is the only one who consumes the sacrificial offerings.

project:
- title: "Goals & Priorities"
  text: This project directly benefits the community by offering visitors an authentic experience of their unique relationship with elephants in their natural habitat. As the traditional custodians of the land and elephants, the Bunong possess invaluable knowledge of the forest and its resources. The increasing demand for elephants threatens their cultural survival, as removing these animals from their home and separating them from the Bunong would be devastating.
    <br><br>
    This program provides an alternative to elephant relocation, respecting both people and animals by preserving their way of life. It allows the Bunong to maintain their traditions while adapting to the challenges of living in a protected forest. Visitors can participate in daily life, including feeding and bathing elephants, learning about their care, and experiencing the unique bond between the Bunong and these magnificent animals.
    <br><br>
    The project prioritizes preserving land for the elephants' foraging needs, sharing Bunong knowledge, culture, and traditions, and fostering cultural understanding through local guides. Operating independently, it ensures that tourism revenue directly supports the Bunong community and their continued stewardship of this land.
- title: "The Role of Tourism"
  text: Tourism has grown in the region in recent years, and the Bunong community wishes to participate in a way that allows them to share their culture with visitors and learn from them in return. This exchange could enable them to preserve their traditional way of life without being forced to leave the forest in search of work in the cities.
    <br><br>
    They rely on your support to maintain their community and protect their elephants from being sold to sanctuaries, where they would be merely displayed as tourist attractions. This program will help the Bunong remain in their village, as you will witness firsthand during your visit. It is vital that the benefits of tourism directly support this community and their continued life on this land.
